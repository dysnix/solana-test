# Yellowstone gRPC benchmark

This benchmark will make request to 2 endpoints, subscribe to all txs stream and compare which of them is faster. 
Network latency between test station and GRPC endpoint does not affect results, as timestamps of transactions are generated by GRPC plugin on server side.

## Requirements

Please install following tools on your machine.

- `grpcurl`
- `jq`

## Run benchmark

1. Please configure adjustable variables inside `tx_latency_bench.sh` file.
2. Run bash script to gather data for comparison. The data will be saved to 2 files.
```bash
bash tx_latency_bench.sh
```
3. Run python script to compare the data.
```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python tx_latency_compare.py <file_1> <file_2>
```
